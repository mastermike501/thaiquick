# thaiquick

I created this project in 2013 for my final year project required by my diploma.

What is it?

It is a web application (not very well built coming from me 3 years later XD) that has a PHP backend, MySQL server and minimal JavaScript
on the client side. Most of the controls are PHP based. The aim of this project was to create a game-like interface for users to learn
the basics of the Thai written language.

Feel free to clone and fork this application!
